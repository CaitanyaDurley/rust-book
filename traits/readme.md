# Traits
Traits are similar to interfaces in other languages

A trait defines functionality that any types implementing that trait will have.

This lets us define a set of behaviours (i.e. a type's methods) necessary to accomplish something.

In this example, we are making a media aggregrator library crate which can display summaries of data stored in a NewsArticle or Tweet struct.
